Question:13
(Asked in Accenture Offcampus 2 Aug 2021, Slot 2)

Problem Statement

You are given a function,

Int MaxExponents (int a , int b);

You have to find and return the number between ‘a’ and ‘b’ ( range inclusive on both ends) which has the maximum exponent of 2.

The algorithm to find the number with maximum exponent of 2 between the given range is

Loop between ‘a’ and ‘b’. Let the looping variable be ‘i’.
Find the exponent (power) of 2 for each ‘i’ and store the number with maximum exponent of 2 so faqrd in a variable , let say ‘max’. Set ‘max’ to ‘i’ only if ‘i’ has more exponent of 2 than ‘max’.
Return ‘max’.
Assumption: a <b

Note: If two or more numbers in the range have the same exponents of  2 , return the small number.

Example

Input:
7
12
Output:
8
Explanation:

Exponents of 2 in:

7-0

8-3

9-0

10-1

11-0

12-2

Hence maximum exponent if two is of 8.
