Implement the following Function 

def differenceofSum(n. m)

The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

Assumption:

n>0 and m>0
Sum lies between integral range
Example

Input
n:4
m:20
Output
90

Explanation

Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
Difference 150 â€“ 60 = 90
Sample Input
n:3
m:10
Sample Output
19
